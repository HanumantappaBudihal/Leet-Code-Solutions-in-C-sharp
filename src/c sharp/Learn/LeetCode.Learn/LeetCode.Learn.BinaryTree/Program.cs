        A tree is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

        Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which 
        are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic
        graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges.

        A Binary Tree is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary 
        tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are 
        referred to as the left child and the right child.

        By completing this card, you will be able to:

        Understand the concept of a tree and a binary tree;
        Be familiar with different traversal methods;
        Use recursion to solve binary-tree-related problems;
